anonymization of network traffic,abstract—the security challenge coming with the popularity of web-based applications is a serious matter. the privacy of the data sent back and for has become a crucial issue. as a matter of fact  in one of their most recent publications  chen et al  analyzed this problem and showed that  although the existence of powerful communication security systems such as https  wpa/wpa2 wi-fi encryption  several high-scaled webapps are exposed to side-channel attacks using timing and a subset of the applications’ internal information flows. in response to it  liu et al developed a privacy model  introduced by chen et al   to prevent this threat. the approach aims to protect the size of the packets exchanged during the communication between the client and the server and makes use of the privacy-preserving traffic padding (pptp). our paper proposes a novel economical mechanism to achieve this pptp on the basis of the well-known privacy preserving method called ldiversity.,security & utilities
